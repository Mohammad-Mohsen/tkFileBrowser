Description: tkFileBrowser
        =============
        
        tkFileBrowser is an alternative to tkinter.filedialog that allows the
        user to select files or directories. The GUI is written with tkinter but
        the look is closer to GTK and the application uses GTK bookmarks (the
        one displayed in nautilus or thunar for instance). This filebrowser
        supports new directory creation and filtype filtering.
        
        This module contains a general `FileBrowser` class which implements the
        filebrowser and the following functions, similar to the one in filedialog:
        
            * `askopenfilename` that allow the selection of a single file
        
            * `askopenfilenames` that allow the selection of multiple files
        
            * `askopendirname` that allow the selection a single folder
        
            * `askopendirnames` that allow the selection of multiple folders
        
            * `asksaveasfilename` that returns a single filename and give a warning if the file already exists
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Linux
        - Python 3 with tkinter + ttk
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        With pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip3 install tkFileBrowser
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        * Optional keywords arguments common to each function
        
            - parent: parent window
        
            - title: the title of the filebrowser window
        
            - initialdir: directory whose content is initially displayed
        
            - initialfile: initially selected item (just the name, not the full path)
        
            - filetypes list: [("name", "\*.ext1|\*.ext2|.."), ...]
              only the files of given filetype will be displayed,
              e.g. to allow the user to switch between displaying only PNG or JPG
              pictures or dispalying all files:
              filtypes=[("Pictures", "\*.png|\*.PNG|\*.jpg|\*.JPG'), ("All files", "\*")]
        
        * askopendirname
        
            Allow the user to choose a single directory. The absolute path of the
            chosen directory is returned. If the user cancels, an empty string is
            returned.
        
        * askopendirnames
        
            Allow the user to choose multiple directories. A tuple containing the absolute
            path of the chosen directories is returned. If the user cancels,
            an empty tuple is returned.
        
        * askopenfilename
        
            Allow the user to choose a single file. The absolute path of the
            chosen file is returned. If the user cancels, an empty string is
            returned.
        
        
        * askopenfilenames
        
            Allow the user to choose multiple files. A tuple containing the absolute
            path of the chosen files is returned. If the user cancels,
            an empty tuple is returned.
        
        * asksaveasfilename
        
            Allow the user to choose a file path. The file may not exist but
            the path to its directory does. If the file already exists, the user
            is asked to confirm its replacement.
        
            Additional option:
                - defaultext: extension added to filename if none is given (default is none)
        
        
        Example
        =======
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import tkinter as tk

            from tkFileBrowser import askopendirnames, asksaveasfilename
        
            root = tk.Tk()
        
            def c_open():
                rep = askopendirnames(parent=root)
                print(rep)
        
            def c_save():
                rep = asksaveasfilename(parent=root, defaultext=".png",
                                        filetypes=[("Pictures", "*.png|*.jpg|*.JPG"), ("All files", "*")])
                print(rep)
        
            ttk.Button(root, text="Open folders", command=c_open).pack()
            ttk.Button(root, text="Save file", command=c_save).pack()
        
            root.mainloop()
